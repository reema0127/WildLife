        <h1>About Yala</h1>
        <p>Yala (යාල) National Park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka, bordering the Indian Ocean. The park consists of five blocks, three of which are now open to the public. There are also two adjoining parks, Kumana National Park or 'Yala East' and Lunugamvehera National Park. The blocks have individual names, such as Palatupana (Block 1). It is situated in the southeastern region of the country, in the Southern Province and Uva Province. The park covers 979 square kilometres (378 sq mi) and is located about 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Colombo. Yala was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, along with Wilpattu, designated in 1938, as the first two designated national parks in Sri Lanka. The park is best known for its variety of wildlife and is important conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds.
            <br><br>
            There are six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Among the largest is Lunugamvehera National Park. The park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain is received mainly during the northeast monsoon. Yala hosts a variety of ecosystems ranging from moist monsoon forests to freshwater and marine wetlands. It is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Yala harbors 215 bird species including six endemic species of Sri Lanka. The number of mammals that has been recorded from the park is 44, and it has one of the highest leopard densities in the world.
            <br><br>
            The area around Yala has hosted several ancient civilizations. Two important Buddhist pilgrim sites, Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, are situated within the park. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused severe damage on the Yala National Park and 250 people died in its vicinity. The number of visitors has been on the rise since 2009, after the security situation in the park improved.
            <br><br>

    <div class="to-do">
        <h1>What to do in Yala ?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Yala Night A thrilling date with nature</h3></li>
              <p>A series of wildlife bungalows operated by the park afford nature enthusiasts to spend a night in the park. These bungalows are very basic, promote
                 open space but give you an unforgettable experience as you experience a night in the animal kingdom. You can book a bungalow here. You can also be out
                  on the beaten track before the rest of the traffic gets in.</p>
            <li><h3>Bird Watching</h3></li>
            <p>The number of water birds inhabiting the wetlands of Yala is around 90, and roughly half of them are migrants. These include waterfowls (Lesser Whistling Duck, Garganey), Cormorants (Little Cormorant, Indian Cormorant), large waterbirds (Grey Heron, Black-headed Ibis, Eurasian Spoonbill, Asian Openbill, Painted Stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. Black-necked Stork and Lesser Adjutant are some of the rare birds that can be seen in the park. The migrant Great White Pelican and resident Spot-billed Pelican have also been sighted at Yala. Other water birds attracted to the Yala lagoons include Lesser Flamingo and pelicans, as well as rare species such as Purple Heron, Night herons, Egrets, Purple Swamphen and the Oriental Darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are Northern Pintail, White-winged Tern, Eurasian Curlew, Whimbrel, Godwits, and Ruddy Turnstone.</p>
            <li><h3>Beach Walks</h3></li>
            <p>While most of the long coastal stretch that hugs the park is out of bounds for the human kind, the park lets you get off at designated places. It gives you a chance to exercise your legs and take a stroll on the golden sandy beaches. The primary beach spot open to public was the location for one of the bungalows which was wiped out by the Asian Tsunami along with its occupants. Remnants of the devastation and a memorial for the dead will offer you a profound moment of silence and solitude.</p>
